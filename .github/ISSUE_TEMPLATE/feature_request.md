name: Pls Adventure
about: Pls Adventure Will give the player 1000 - 5000 Coins and 3 grandteed items which can be anything related to the pls hunt command. There is also a 15% Chance to get an item which once could be anything, and has a cool down of 2 Hours and Donors have one of 1 hour 25 Minutes. To start the Adventure the player needs 1 Hunting Rifle, If they are going solo A pet that isn't a crab,turtle or a rock, and there hunting stat needs to be maxed out. Once the criteria is complete the player can start their adventure. Once they say Pls Adventure or Pls adv it will say "{Player Name} has started their adventure, say, Pls Join Adventure, To go along with them! (1/4). 3 People can join the adventure which increases the chance of triggering a boss fight. After 30 Seconds the adventure will begin. The player the has to do 3 fights(or tasks) each which could be taken or inspired from pls pet play or pls work. If they fail once they dies. If there are people with them it wont end but the other players can take a shot at it. If they succed the player which died will get revived but will lose some money and may lose some items. If they are solo their pet could rescue them by putting the player to safty. If all three tasks are preformed successfully and no one has died then there is a chance a boss can spawn. The boss will have 500HP which is taken from the Karen thingy. The player(s) then need to type something which could be whatever you'd please. If they are solo however then depending on the stats of the pet the player would get damage increases. If the player(s) fail to do the command during the given time the player will die and there is a SMALL chance that the player could lost their pet. There are 3 Bosses Dragon, Kuthlu, and Beta Pepe.
